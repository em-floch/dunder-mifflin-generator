## Generating The Office script with Transformer

In this project, I build a simple transformer model to generate The Office script. The model is trained on The Office full script found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/b30288/every_line_from_every_episode_of_the_office/).
The model is trained on my local machine with a single GPU. The training process takes about 1 hour with the current parameters.
